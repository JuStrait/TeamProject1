# TeamProject1

Our team is going to make a date planner application.

Our user will first select a date.

We will generate local events based on the input.

When an event is selected, we will generate restaurant locations in the area.

When a restaurant is selected, we will generate the weather data for that date and location.

The Apis we will be using are: TicketMaster, Zomato, and OpenWeatherMap
